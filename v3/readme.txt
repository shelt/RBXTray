 Allows you to minimize windows in the tray area on
 taskbar by clicking right mouse button on the window's
 minimize/close box or from system menu or from window's system menu, or by Win-T hotkey.
 Allows to set any window in "Always on top" state from window's system menu.

 ver. 3.4: Optional Keyboard indicator (NumLock, CapsLock, ScrollLock status)

 ver. 3.3: Minor fix with hiding taskbar by Win-T if start menu is open.
 		 (Win, Win-T - hides taskbar)

 ver. 3.2: Minor fix with pop-up menu for cases when taskbar is placed on any side of the screen, except of bottom.

 ver. 3.1: Global system hotkey: Win-T will minimize current window to tray area.

 ver. 3.0: changes by JD P (http://ww.moitah.net/)
 			* The previous version restores an application when it
				detects a mouse-down on the tray icon, but then the
				tray icon is removed and the mouse-up goes to a
				different icon. It now restores an application only
				after detecting a mouse-down and a mouse-up.
			* Added a feature to restore icons owned by RBTray
				after Explorer crashes and restarts.

			Also I included script for NSIS installer (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/) 
			in sources to allow contributors easily make setup file. If you make modified version
            please send me a note to nredko@gmail.com.	

 
 ver. 2.9: fixed bug with Windows XP keyboard switcher (Language Panel)
